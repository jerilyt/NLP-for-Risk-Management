## What is NLP systems
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subcategory of artificial intelligence (AI) that builds bridges between human language and computer processing. NLP analysis can extract and process information from a wide range of online and print sources, including newspapers, emails, social media posts, financial reports, press releases, shipping information, shopping histories, GPS, satellite data, and databases. Additionally, NLP facilitates the machinated processing of spoken language. Although NLP tools must be further developed to minimize shortfalls, the potential of NLP promises enhanced risk assessments for businesses, organizations, and other stakeholders.

## NLP System
NLP is based on supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms. During supervised algorithmic processing, data scientists feed the system a training data set which consists of data, or input, that is labeled according to the data scientist’s desired output. For instance, certain words or phrases, such as “happy,” “sunshine,” or “success,” will be labeled with a positive sentiment, whereas terms like “frustration” or “pain” are labeled with a negative sentiment. Language, however, is not always this straightforward. The human ability to understand language also relies heavily on appropriately interpreting connotation and context-based meaning. This includes ambiguous, sarcastic, ironic, or other rhetorical messages. NLP systems may label a text like “Good job, Mr. President” as positive, even when it is intended to be sarcastic. This is where machine-based learning must be further refined.
